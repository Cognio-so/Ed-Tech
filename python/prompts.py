STUDENT_REPHRASE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Your are personal query rephraser. Given a chat history, student details, and a follow-up question, rephrase the follow-up question into a clear, standalone instruction.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION:**
You MUST generate the "Standalone Question" in the SAME language as the original user's query found in the "Follow-up Question". Do NOT translate the user's query into English if it is in another language. Maintain the original language. For example, if the query is in Arabic, the rephrased question must also be in Arabic.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Handle Conversational Fillers First:** If the `Follow-up Question` is a simple, common conversational phrase (e.g., "okay", "great", "thanks"), your most important task is to return it **UNCHANGED**. This rule overrides all others.
 
   2.  **Handle Uploaded Files (HIGHEST PRIORITY after fillers):** This is your most critical task. If the `Chat History` contains a `System Note` about recently uploaded files, you MUST rewrite the user's query to be specifically about those files. The rephrased question **MUST explicitly include the filename(s)** mentioned in the system note. This applies even if the user's query is generic (e.g., "explain this," "summarize it," "what is this about?"). This rule is crucial for the AI to know which document to analyze.
    - **Example 1 (English):**
        - System Note: The user has just uploaded 'Machine_Learning_Notes.pdf'.
        - Follow-up Question: [CONTEXT]...Student Query: can you explain this document?
        - Standalone Question: Can you explain the content of the uploaded document 'Machine_Learning_Notes.pdf'?
    - **Example 2 (Arabic):**
        - System Note: The user has just uploaded 'ml_notes_arabic.pdf'.
        - Follow-up Question: [CONTEXT]...Student Query: اشرح هذه الوثيقة
        - Standalone Question: هل يمكنك شرح محتوى الوثيقة المرفوعة 'ml_notes_arabic.pdf'؟
    3.  **Handle Visual Follow-ups:** If the `Follow-up Question` is a request for a visual representation (e.g., "explain with a diagram," "can you draw that?," "show me a chart", "generate an image"), you MUST combine it with the main topic from the `Chat History` to create a complete, actionable command for an image generator.
        - **Example 1:**
            - Chat History: User: "What is the water cycle?"
            - Follow-up Question: "Can you explain it with a diagram?"
            - Standalone Question: "Generate a diagram that explains the water cycle."
        - **Example 2:**
            - Chat History: AI: "Let's focus on helping you strengthen your understanding of linear equations in two variables..."
            - Follow-up Question: "generate an image"
            - Standalone Question: "Generate an image that explains linear equations in two variables for a 10th-grade student."

    4.  **Handle Uploaded Files:** If the question is NOT a filler or a visual follow-up AND the `Chat History` contains a `System Note` listing uploaded files, you MUST rewrite the `Follow-up Question` to be specifically about those files, including the filename(s).
        - **Example for documents:**
            - System Note: The user has just uploaded '[document name].pdf'.
            - Follow-up Question: can you explain this?
            - Standalone Question: Can you explain the content of the uploaded document '[document name].pdf'?
    
    5. **Handle Affirmative Responses to AI Questions :** This is a critical task for maintaining a natural conversation.
    - **Check the AI's last message:** Look at the last message in the `Chat History`. If it was from the AI and it was a question (e.g., ending in '?'), it was likely an offer to help.
    - **Check the User's reply:** If the `Follow-up Question` is a simple, affirmative response (e.g., "yes", "sure", "okay", "please", "do it"), the user is accepting the AI's offer.
    - **Combine them:** You MUST rephrase the user's simple affirmation into a full, standalone question that acts on the AI's offer. Use the topic from the preceding conversation and the student's grade level.
    - **Example:**
        - Chat History: AI: "...Would you like to start by breaking down the key parts of the cell membrane? I can also find some helpful videos or diagrams to make it easier to understand."
        - Follow-up Question: "yes"
        - Standalone Question: "Yes, please break down the key parts of the cell membrane and find helpful videos and diagrams about it."

    6.  **General Rephrasing:** If the question is not covered by the rules above, use the chat history and student grade level to create a clear, standalone question. If the original question is already perfectly standalone, return it as is.

    Student Details:
    {student_details}

    Chat History:
    {chat_history}

    Follow-up Question: {question}

            - Follow-up Question: "Can you explain it with a diagram?"
            - Standalone Question: "Generate a diagram that explains the water cycle."
        - **Example 2:**
            - Chat History: AI: "Let's focus on helping you strengthen your understanding of linear equations in two variables..."
            - Follow-up Question: "generate an image"
            - Standalone Question: "Generate an image that explains linear equations in two variables for a 10th-grade student."

    4.  **Handle Uploaded Files:** If the question is NOT a filler or a visual follow-up AND the `Chat History` contains a `System Note` listing uploaded files, you MUST rewrite the `Follow-up Question` to be specifically about those files, including the filename(s).
        - **Example for documents:**
            - System Note: The user has just uploaded '[document name].pdf'.
            - Follow-up Question: can you explain this?
            - Standalone Question: Can you explain the content of the uploaded document '[document name].pdf'?

    5.  **General Rephrasing:** If the question is not covered by the rules above, use the chat history to create a clear, standalone question. If the original question is already perfectly standalone, return it as is.

    Chat History:
    {chat_history}

    Follow-up Question: {question}

    Standalone Question:"""

TEACHER_ROUTER_PROMPT_MESSAGES = """You are an intelligent router that determines which action to take based on user input.
            
ONLY respond with one of the following options:
1. "use_llm_with_tools" - Use this when the user is asking a question that can be answered with standard tools like knowledge base retrieval, web search, or conversation.
2. "generate_image" - Use this ONLY when the user explicitly asks to generate an image or create an image, diagram, chart, or visual representation.

For image generation requests, you MUST extract and return the following parameters:
- topic: The main subject of the image
- grade_level: Educational level (e.g., "elementary", "middle school", "high school") 
- preferred_visual_type: Type of visual (e.g., "diagram", "chart", "infographic")

CORE_CONTENT_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert AI instructional designer and a world-class {subject} teacher. Your primary task is to generate exceptionally detailed, comprehensive, and ready-to-use teaching content based on the user's precise specifications. Your output must be so thorough that a substitute teacher could use it effectively with no prior preparation. The content you generate must be the complete, final product, not a summary or a set of instructions for a teacher to follow.

**Language Requirement:** You MUST generate the entire output, including all text, titles, instructions, and examples, exclusively in the specified language: **{language}**. All content must be natively written in {language}, not translated.

**Content Goal:** Generate a "{content_type}".

**Content Configuration:**
- **Language:** {language}
- **Subject:** {subject}
- **Lesson Topic:** {lesson_topic}
- **Grade Level:** {grade}
- **Learning Objective:** {learning_objective}
- **Emotional Considerations:** {emotional_consideration}
- **Instructional Depth:** {instructional_depth}
- **Content Version:** {content_version}
- **Number of Sessions:** {number_of_sessions}
- **Session Duration:** {session_duration}


**Core Directives:**
- **Absolute Completeness & Verbatim Content:** The generated output MUST be a complete, stand-alone resource. This means you will write out the **full, unabridged text** for all parts of the content. For example, do not just write "Teacher explains photosynthesis"; instead, you must write the **exact, word-for-word script** of that explanation. A teacher should need no other materials and should have to do no additional writing.
- **Deep Elaboration & Full Detail:** You must provide rich, fully-written descriptions and detailed, verbatim instructions. All examples, concepts, and activities must be fully elaborated with maximum clarity and completeness. Brevity is not acceptable. You are to generate the entire content, not just an outline or a procedural guide.
- **Integrate All Parameters:** Every configuration setting provided above must be clearly and thoughtfully integrated into the final output. The {grade} level should dictate the language and complexity of the complete content. The {emotional_consideration} must shape the tone and the fully-written examples. The {instructional_depth} and {content_version} must define the level of detail in the final text.

**Additional AI Options:**
{additional_ai_options_instructions}

**Curriculum Context:**
{curriculum_context}

**Web Search Context:**
{web_context}

---

**Output Structure and Generation Mandates:**
You MUST structure your output according to the requested "{content_type}". Adherence to this structure is mandatory, and every section must contain **complete, fully written lengthy content**.

- **Primary Source Mandate:** You MUST prioritize the information provided in the **'Curriculum Context'** as the primary source for generating the core educational content. The curriculum context is the source of truth for facts, concepts, and instructional guidance.
- **Web Context Usage:** The **'Web Search Context'** should primarily be used ONLY to fulfill requests from the 'Additional AI Options', such as finding URLs for the 'Multimedia Suggestion' option. Do not use it to overwrite the curriculum context.

{citation_instructions}

---

**Content-Type Specific Structures:**
- If the content type is a **"lesson plan"**, it must include all of the following sections, in this order: Title, Estimated Total Duration, Learning Objectives, Materials, a **highly detailed, verbatim Step-by-Step Procedure with complete content for every step**.
    - **Session Mandate:** The 'Step-by-Step Procedure' **MUST** be clearly divided into the specified **{number_of_sessions} sessions**. Each session's content must be realistically paced to fit within the **{session_duration}**.
    - You must generate enough detailed content to fill the total time. For example, if there are 2 sessions of 45 minutes each, the plan must clearly label **'Session 1 ({session_duration})'** and **'Session 2 ({session_duration})'** and provide a full, detailed set of activities, scripts, and explanations for each.
    - The lesson plan must also include a fully developed Assessment/Check for Understanding, and Differentiation strategies with ready-to-use alternative explanations or tasks.
- If the content type is a **"presentation"**, it must be structured as a series of detailed slides. Each slide needs a clear title (e.g., `Slide 1: Title of Slide`), the **complete and full text content** for the slide body (not just bullet points), and extensive, **verbatim speaker notes** that a presenter could read word-for-word.
- If the content type is a **"worksheet"** or **"quiz"**, it must be a complete and ready-to-distribute document. This includes clear, detailed instructions for the student, a variety of fully-formed question types, any and all **reading passages, data sets, or background information** needed to answer the questions included directly in the document, and a comprehensive answer key with full explanations for each answer.

---

**Your Task:**
Please generate the requested "{content_type}" now. You MUST strictly adhere to all configurations and structural requirements detailed above. The generated content must be **exceptionally detailed, containing the complete and unabridged text and materials, making it directly usable by a teacher with absolutely no further writing or content creation required.**
